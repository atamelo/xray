# The following commands set up redirection of DNS traffic from the router's clients into the tunnel.
# Clients are supposed to be configuread with the router's address as their DNS server.
# The upstream DNS of the local router's DNS server (AdGuard/dsnmasq) is set to 1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1;
# We need to first catch in the OUTPUT chain it and set a mark - when seeing a marked packet the system will know
# that the packet needs to be put throught the PREROUTING chain where we redirect it to the TPROXY that further
# sends the packet into the tunnel
# (note that the router itself uses DNS server set on it WAN or WWAN interfaces - 9.9.9.9/9.9.9.10
# and so its DNS queries are not redirected)
